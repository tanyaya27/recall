# Decisions

Running log of choices and the reasoning behind them. Newest at the top.
Add an entry whenever a choice was non-obvious, had a real alternative, or would be
tempting to reverse later without knowing why it was made.

Format: date — decision — why — what would change our mind.

## 2026-08-31 — One git repo for the whole ReCall folder, not just the app

**Decision:** the repo root is `ReCall/`, so design docs, strategy, spec and code all
travel together. Pages build output moved to `ReCall/docs/`.

**Why:** Tanya works across two machines. If the repo were only `recall-app/`, cloning it
on a second machine would deliver the code without the thinking behind it — and the app
README's reference to `../../03_Design/ReCall_v0_Spec.docx` would break. The reasoning is
as valuable as the code, so it belongs in the same repo.

**Alternative rejected:** separate repos for docs and app, or a GitHub Actions workflow to
publish a nested subfolder. Both add moving parts a solo student builder has to maintain.

**Would change our mind:** if the design folder grows huge with binary assets and slows
clones, split the media out rather than the documents.

## 2026-08-31 — GitHub is the only sync mechanism; no iCloud/Dropbox on the repo

**Decision:** each machine keeps an ordinary local clone outside any cloud-synced folder.

**Why:** file-sync services corrupt `.git` — they sync thousands of small files out of
order, create "conflicted copy" duplicates inside `.git`, and can evict files to the cloud.
GitHub already does this job correctly.

**Would change our mind:** nothing. This one is settled.

## 2026-08-30 — Photos stored inline in Firestore, not Firebase Storage

**Decision:** compress to ~100–180KB JPEG and store in the Firestore document.

**Why:** avoids Storage bucket setup and CORS configuration entirely at v0 scale. Fewer
things to get wrong before the first working demo.

**Would change our mind:** item counts in the hundreds, or a need for full-resolution
originals. Then move to Storage.

## 2026-08-30 — esbuild instead of Vite

**Decision:** bundle with esbuild; React and Firebase load from a CDN import map.

**Why:** pivoted mid-build when the sandbox ran out of disk installing Vite. The source is
standard React and migrates to Vite unchanged if we ever need the richer dev server.

**Would change our mind:** needing HMR, environment variables, or a plugin ecosystem.

## 2026-08-30 — AI vendor behind a two-method abstraction

**Decision:** components call only `engine.tagPhoto()` / `engine.answerQuery()`. Providers
implement `visionJSON` and `textJSON`.

**Why:** vendor choice is a settings toggle, not a refactor. Also creates the seam for
future on-device/private routing via the `sensitivity` flag — a real requirement for an
app handling dementia patients' home photos.

**Would change our mind:** nothing foreseeable. Keep this seam intact.
